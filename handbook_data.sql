HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE PAMANTASAN NG LUNGSOD NG MUNTINLUPA (PLMUN)
The establishment of a local university in the Municipality started as a dream of former Mayor Ignacio “Toting” Bunye who viewed education as potent tool for transforming society for the better. Upon his assumption of office in 1986, he included the objective of organizing and establishing an institution of higher learning in the Ten Point Agenda of his administration.
During his term as Councilor and Chairman of the Committee on Education, Rufino B. Joaquin sponsored the move to organize
and establish the  Muntinlupa Polytechnic College (MPC). On May 29, 1991 the Municipal Council of        Muntinlupa passed
Resolution No. 91- 191 and Resolution No. 91- 192 officially creating a government run college – the Muntinlupa Polytechnic College (MPC)
Muntinlupa Polytechnic College (MPC) started with 309 students while using one of the high school buildings of the Pedro E. Diaz High School in Alabang, Muntinlupa City. As its enrollment of students increased, the Muntinlupa Polytechnic College   (MPC) was relocated to the second floor of the Contessa Bulding in Barangay Poblacion, Muntinlupa City where all of its the  offices and classrooms were air- conditioned.
Courses offered then at the Muntinlupa Polytechnic College (MPC) were as follows:  Bachelor of Arts in Psychology,
Bachelor of Science in Commerce, Bachelor of Science in Accountancy, Bachelor of Elementary Education, Bachelor of
Secondary Education,  Bachelor of Science in Criminology, Bachelor of Science in Industrial Technology, and two-year courses in Computer Science and Secretarial Science.
Imbued with the desire to be in close coordination with the National Government in providing higher education, the Muntinlupa Polytechnic College (MPC) established a linkage with the Commission of Higher Education (CHED-NCR).
The rapid growth of the student population at the Muntinlupa Polytechnic College (MPC) ushered in the need for more changes.
In 1995, due to the high educational standards and numerous courses it offered, the number of students increased. This prompted  a need for more space and facilities. This served as a challenge to Muntinlupa which by then in 1995 had just been elevated to the status of a City.
In response to the challenge, in March 1988, the Muntinlupa Polytechnic College (MPC) moved out of the Contessa Building to
its own new building in a bigger campus with better facilities. The City Government had a new two-storey building constructed and completed alongside the Muntinlupa National High School, in a two hectare site in the NBP Reservation Compound,
Poblacion, Muntinlupa City.
Upon his assumption of office in 1998, Mayor Jaime R. Fresnedi had education as a priority in the Eight Point Program of his   Administration. Compulsory Education was extended to everyone, especially, to the marginalized sector. In 2002, the new four storey Academic Building was completed to house the library and Auditorium and to provide additional classrooms in its third  and fourth floors. The new Academic Building further enhanced the ability of the Muntinlupa Polytechnic College to produce   highly educated young residents who would eventually contribute to the development of themselves, their loved ones and the    City of Muntinlupa.
Former Dean Enrico Vivar led the movement to convert the Muntinlupa Polytechnic College into a local university. Atty. Raul R. Corro, then Councilor and Chairman of the Committee on Education, sponsored City Ordinance No. 03-089 converting the
Muntinlupa Polytechnic College to a Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Muntinlupa (PLMun) in March, 2003 during the 67th session.
The Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Muntinlupa has three buildings: the Main Building, the Annex Building  and the Administration Building.
The PLMun has attained recognition by CHED as leading Higher Educational Institution (HEI) offering of various relevant courses such as: General Education, Criminal Justice, Teacher Education, Business Administration, Arts and Sciences,
Information Technology and Computer Studies.
As Education Mayor, during his term (1997—2006), Mayor Jaime R. Fresnedi and the City Council approved the Iskolar ng Bayan Ordinance No. 98-008 which provided additional scholarship incentives for indigent but deserving PLMun students.
Seeing the need to sustain empowerment among young Muntinlupenos, the 7th SangguniangPanglungsod passed a resolution to increase student financial assistance, hence Honorable Mayor Jaime R. Fresnedi, passed a decree on October 13, 2013, creating  Ordinance No.13-010 (Amending Ordinance No.08-042) which provided for even more incentives for scholars.
The Board of Regents and management are continuously making sure that the PLMun and its faculty provide quality and relevant education that would produce graduates who are creative, productive, socially responsible and locally and globally competitive.
Past and Present Administrators and Presidents
THE PLMUN SEAL
The University Seal of the PLMun is the most visible identification mark of the University. Patterned after the official Seal of the City of Muntinlupa; the Torch symbolizes the role of education in the attainment of the City’s Vision: To make Muntinlupa the   Premiere Emerald City of the 21st Century.
Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Muntinlupa - the name “PAMANTASAN NG LUNGSOD NG MUNTINLUPA” in bold Arial font serves
as a border around the outer portion of the seal.
Torch - the Torch reflects the objective of education: to enlighten the students; and to provide them with the intellectual nurture that draws them away from the elements of destruction.
The Bamboo Seal - Bamboo around the seal projects the resiliency of the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Muntinlupa (PLMun) students to the challenges of the times. The bamboo signifies the endurance and the capability of the PLMun students to
overcome trials and emerge victorious in life.
Lakas Talino at Buhay - Lifted from the lyrics of the City’s official anthem, the City of Muntinlupa March, Lakas, Talino at Buhay are the three main objectives which indicate the University’s vision and mission.
1991 - 2003 - the year 1991 marks the time when the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Muntinlupa (PLMun) was established, while the year 2003 indicates the time when the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Muntinlupa (PLMun), then Muntinlupa Polytechnic
College (MPC), acquired its University status.
The Philippine Flag - the flag that provides the background of the Torch draws the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Muntinlupa
(PLMun) into the reality that it is apart of the Republic of the Philippines and the City Government of Muntinlupa. The Torch   scintillates and marks its effects on all areas affected by its radiance. Like education, the University views its significance in the process of nation building.
The Nine Stars - the nine (9) stars represent the nine (9) barangays of the City of Muntinlupa, namely: Tunasan, Poblacion, Putatan, and Bayanan for District I and Alabang, Cupang, Buli, Sucat and Ayala Alabang for District II.
The University Color - the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Muntinlupa (PLMun) established bamboo green as its official University color.
Philosophy of the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Muntinlupa (PLMun)
Imbued with the provision of the 1987 Constitution which mandates the State to give priority to education, science, technology,
culture and the arts, the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Muntinlupa (PLMun) premised its philosophy on the rationale of establishing an educational institution in the tertiary level which reflects on the mandated provisions.
The Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Muntinlupa (PLMun) aims to promote intellectual growth, to initiate the advancement of
learning and research, to develop responsible and effective leaders, to create esteemed professionals, to enrich the country’s
historical and cultural heritage, to provide quality education for the Muntinlupeños, primarily, and to prepare them to meet the demands of the global market, thus, enabling them to become responsible and employable citizens.
As a learning institution, Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Muntinlupa’s educational paradigm of curricular programs shows values, academic and technical-orientation aimed at cultivating the mind, spirit and body in the service of God, the country and the
community.
